# Main

OWASP Broken Web Applications Project is a collection of vulnerable web applications that is distributed on a Virtual Machine.

# Description

The Broken Web Applications (BWA) Project produces a Virtual Machine running a variety of applications with known vulnerabilities for those interested in:
- learning about web application security
- testing manual assessment techniques
- testing automated tools
- testing source code analysis tools
- observing web attacks
- testing WAFs and similar code technologies

All the while saving people interested in doing either learning or testing the pain of having to compile, configure, and catalog all of the things normally involved in doing this process from scratch.

# Licensing

OWASP Broken Web Applications Project is free to use. Any custom code / modifications are GPLv2, but this does not override the license of each individual software package we incorporate. All software is open source.
